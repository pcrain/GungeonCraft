### Features

- 22 new guns 
- 22 new passive items
- 9 new active items
- Lore for all new guns and items
- A new boss!
- You can pet Junior \o/
- You can become the greatest janitor the Gungeon has ever seen O:

### Goals

- **Balance and Diversity**: no item should be so underwhelming you never want to use it, nor so overpowered you never want to use anything else
- **Fun New Mechanics**: most items and guns should offer their own distinct ways of interacting with the Gungeon, and low tier items shouldn't be low fun items as well
- **Playstyle Variety**: defensive and strategic play should feel as rewarding as aggressive and proactive play

### Known Bugs
* Mid-run saving might not correctly save the internal state of some of the new items
* If you find any more, please let me know!

### FAQ

* Found a Bug?
	- [Open an Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/pcrain/GungeonCraft/issues)! Please bear in mind that I work on this in my free time for fun, so I might not fix every bug, but I'll do my best to get to all of the important ones. C:
* Balance or Feature Suggestion?
	- [Submit it here!](https://github.com/pcrain/GungeonCraft/issues/1) I'm always open to more ideas, but I also have a spreadsheet with 160 or so ideas in it already, so no guarantees I get around to everything. O:
* Where do I find the new boss?
	- Try talking to Bello a few dozen times! He'll give you a hint eventually (dialogue is RNG and I can't find a way around it D: ).

### Wiki

May or may not be coming soon, but all of the information and lore you'll ever need can be found in-game in the Ammonomicon. O:
