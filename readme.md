### Goals

- **Balance and Diversity**: all items and guns should be fun, engaging, and useful in a variety of situations
- **Fun New Mechanics**: most items and guns should offer their own distinct ways of interacting with the Gungeon
- **Playstyle Variety**: defensive and strategic play should feel as rewarding as aggressive and proactive play

### Known Bugs
* None at the moment! If you find any, please let me know!

### Vanilla Bugs Fixed
* In co-op Turbo Mode, the 2nd player now has the same speed as the first player without having to die first
* When saving and reloading a run, guns no longer lose any other guns duct-taped to them
* Rooms that can only spawn once per run (e.g., specialty shops) are now properly marked as "not spawned this run" after a Quick Restart
* Certain algorithms for shuffling the order of a list (e.g., for floor generation) will now randomly shuffle the first and last items in the list
* Orbiting guns no longer shoot projectiles from a weird position if created while the player is facing left
* VFX that play on the ammo display when firing a gun no longer render behind final projectiles

### FAQ

* Found a Bug?
	- [Open an Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/pcrain/GungeonCraft/issues)! Please bear in mind that I work on this in my free time for fun, so I might not fix every bug, but I'll do my best to get to all of the important ones. C:
* Where do I find the new boss?
	- Try talking to Bello a few dozen times! He'll give you a hint eventually (dialogue is RNG and I can't find a way around it D: ).
* Why does my gun say "Normal" above it?
	- Try beating the new boss :>
