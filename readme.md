### Goals

- **Balance and Diversity**: all items and guns should be fun, engaging, and useful in a variety of situations
- **Fun New Mechanics**: most items and guns should offer their own distinct ways of interacting with the Gungeon
- **Playstyle Variety**: defensive and strategic play should feel as rewarding as aggressive and proactive play

### FAQ

* Found a Bug?
	- [Open an Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/pcrain/GungeonCraft/issues)! Please bear in mind that I work on this in my free time for fun, so I might not fix every bug, but I'll do my best to get to all of the important ones. C:
* Where do I find the new boss?
	- Try talking to Bello a few dozen times! He'll give you a hint eventually (dialogue is RNG and I can't find a way around it D: ).
* Why does my gun say "Normal" above it?
	- Try beating the new boss :>
