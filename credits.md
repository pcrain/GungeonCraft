# Credits

I have no artistic talent beyond making minor sprite and sound edits, so all base sprites and sounds are from other games and talented artists. It is very possible (and likely) I'm missing a few people, but I've done my best to credit everyone below. I used a lot of stuff from all over and didn't do a great job of keeping tracking of where it all came from, so please contact me if you see your art and I'd be happy to credit you. ;v;

### Code

- Mostly my own, some helper classes and functions taken from [Apache Thunder](https://github.com/ApacheThunder/ExpandTheGungeon/tree/BepInEx), [Nevernamed](https://github.com/Nevernamed22/OnceMoreIntoTheBreach/tree/master), [Neighborino](https://github.com/Neighborin0/FrostAndGunfire), [Some Bunny](https://github.com/Some-Bunny/Planetside), and [SpecialAPI](https://github.com/SpecialAPI/ModTheGungeonAPI).

### Sprites

* Base Gun sprites from several sources, including the following:
 	- Classical from The Gungeon Discord
	- [IdioticMuffin from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnterTheGungeon/comments/et316d/yet_even_more_gun_concepts_for_gungeon/)
	- [mrgranade from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnterTheGungeon/comments/zo5ak8/i_designed_some_crazy_guns_i_wish_were_available/)
	- mrgranade's game, [Raining Blood](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2147530/Raining_Blood_Hellfire/)
	- [Terraria](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Guns) and many of its various mods including (but probably not limited to) [Tremor](https://tremormod.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons#Guns), [Exodus](https://exodusmod.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons#Guns), [The Spirit Mod](https://spiritmod.wiki.gg/wiki/Weapons#Guns), [Calamity](https://calamitymod.fandom.com/wiki/Guns), [Thorium](https://thoriummod.fandom.com/wiki/Guns), [Shadows of Abaddon](https://shadowsofabaddon.wiki.gg/wiki/Weapons#Guns), and [Mod of Redemption](https://modofredemption.wiki.gg/wiki/Weapons#Guns)
	- Most animation edits are my own, but probably aren't as good as the animations of the guns in their respective games / mods, so please check the original sources out!
