# Credits

I have no artistic talent beyond making minor sprite and sound edits, so all base sprites and sounds are from other games and talented artists. It is very possible (and likely) I'm missing a few people, but I've done my best to credit everyone below. I used a lot of stuff from all over and didn't do a great job of keeping tracking of where it all came from, so please contact me if you see your art and I'd be happy to credit you. ;v;

### Code

- Mostly my own, some helper classes and functions taken from [Apache Thunder](https://github.com/ApacheThunder/ExpandTheGungeon/tree/BepInEx), [Nevernamed](https://github.com/Nevernamed22/OnceMoreIntoTheBreach/tree/master), [Neighborino](https://github.com/Neighborin0/FrostAndGunfire), [Some Bunny](https://github.com/Some-Bunny/Planetside), and [SpecialAPI](https://github.com/SpecialAPI/ModTheGungeonAPI).

### Sprites

* Several custom shopkeeper, gun, item, clip, projectile, and miscellaneous sprites by [Lynceus](https://enter-the-gungeon.thunderstore.io/package/Lynceus/The_Captain_Custom_Character/)
* Most hat sprites plus various gun, item, and NPC sprites by [Dallan](https://enter-the-gungeon.thunderstore.io/package/Dallan/Breach_Renovations/)
* Base Gun sprites from several sources, including the following:
 	- Classical from The Gungeon Discord

	- [mrgranade from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnterTheGungeon/comments/zo5ak8/i_designed_some_crazy_guns_i_wish_were_available/)

	- [Terraria](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Guns) and many of its various mods including (but probably not limited to) [Tremor](https://tremormod.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons#Guns), [Exodus](https://exodusmod.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons#Guns), [The Spirit Mod](https://spiritmod.wiki.gg/wiki/Weapons#Guns), [Calamity](https://calamitymod.fandom.com/wiki/Guns), [Thorium](https://thoriummod.fandom.com/wiki/Guns), [Shadows of Abaddon](https://shadowsofabaddon.wiki.gg/wiki/Weapons#Guns), and [Mod of Redemption](https://modofredemption.wiki.gg/wiki/Weapons#Guns)
	- [Duck Game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/312530/Duck_Game/)
	- Most animation edits are my own, but probably aren't as good as the animations of the guns in their respective games / mods, so please check the original sources out!
