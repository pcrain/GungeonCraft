# Credits

I have no artistic talent beyond making minor sprite and sound edits, so all base sprites and sounds are from other games and talented artists. It is very possible (and likely) I'm missing a few people, but I've done my best to credit everyone below. I used a lot of stuff from all over and didn't do a great job of keeping tracking of where it all came from, so please contact me if you see your art and I'd be happy to credit you. ;v;

### Code

- Mostly my own, some helper classes and functions taken from [Apache Thunder](https://github.com/ApacheThunder/ExpandTheGungeon/tree/BepInEx), [Nevernamed](https://github.com/Nevernamed22/OnceMoreIntoTheBreach/tree/master), [Neighborino](https://github.com/Neighborin0/FrostAndGunfire), [Some Bunny](https://github.com/Some-Bunny/Planetside), and [SpecialAPI](https://github.com/SpecialAPI/ModTheGungeonAPI).

	- [Duck Game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/312530/Duck_Game/)
	- Most animation edits are my own, but probably aren't as good as the animations of the guns in their respective games / mods, so please check the original sources out!
