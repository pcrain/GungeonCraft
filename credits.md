# Credits

I have little artistic ability beyond making minor sprite and sound edits, so most sprites and sounds are from other games and talented artists. It is very possible I'm missing a few people, but I've done my best to credit everyone below. I used a lot of stuff from all over and didn't do a great job of keeping tracking of where it all came from, so please contact me if you see your art and I'd be happy to credit you. ;v;

### Code
